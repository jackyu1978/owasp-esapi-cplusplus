Welcome to the home page at Google for the ESAPI for C++ project. ESAPI (The [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Enterprise Security API) is a free, [open source](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The overall ESAPI project has a high level goal of producing these free security libraries for most popular programming languages. This project is the C++ specific version of that goal. Please view the [ESAPI home page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) for more details on the overall project, its philosophy, and to see the other languages that ESAPI libraries have been written for.

The purpose of ESAPI is to provide a simple interface that provides all the security functions a developer is likely to need in a clear, consistent, and easy to use way. The ESAPI architecture is very simple, just a collection of modules that encapsulate the key security operations most applications need.

This stripped down version of ESAPI will feature functionality similar to [ESAPI for C](http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-c/), but the interfaces will have more of an OO flavor and be based on [ESAPI for Java](http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/).

Mailing list for this project is located at https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-esapi-c++.

You can view the latest API docs at http://owasp-esapi-cplusplus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/index.html.
This reflects only what has been implemented so far.

This API is still in a development state, and **not ready for production usage**.
