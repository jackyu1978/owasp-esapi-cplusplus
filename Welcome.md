# Introduction #

Welcome to ESAPI C++. [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) is the Open Web Application Security Project, and [ESAPI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API) is its Enterprise Security API.

ESAPI for C++ is sponsored by the United States Government

# Details #

ESAPI is a free, open source, security control library for a number of languages, including ASP, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective C, Java, and .Net. ESAPI is used by a growing number of security conscious organizations, including American Express, Apache Foundation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Aspect Security, Foundstone (McAfee), The Hartford, Infinite Campus, Lockheed Martin, MITRE, The World Bank, and the SANS Institute.

The ESAPI library facilitates writing lower-risk applications by making it easier to retrofit security into existing applications, and provides a solid foundation for new development.  ESAPI C++ is a scaled down version of the library offered in other languages. The C++ version uses Wei Dai's [Crypto++](http://www.cryptopp.com/) for cryptographic operations, and the [SafeInt](http://safeint.codeplex.com/) class written by David LeBlanc for safe integer operations. To install Crypto++ on Windows or Linux, see the [ESAPI Crypto++ page](http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-cplusplus/wiki/CryptoPP).
